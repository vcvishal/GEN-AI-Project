# GEN-AI-Project


Capstone Project
___________________________________________________________________________________
Project Title: Research Paper Answer Bot
Project Type: 2 Weeks Capstone Project
Learner Name: <ENTER HERE>
Project Description / Business case:
The scenario is that you are working for a company like ArXiv which has a repository of the
latest and best papers around AI and Data Science. They want to build an intelligent chatbot
which can help answer questions which people ask on popular topics based on research papers
in Generative AI. Considering the limited time-frame of the project, we have limited the dataset
to a few documents.
The broad idea of this project is to build a RAG system on top of some of the famous seminal
research papers around Generative AI and LLMs, this system should be able to index the
papers into a vector database, use good retrieval strategies to retrieve relevant contextual
documents based on your input queries and generate proper responses. The focus of this
project is not just to build a simple RAG system but explore various approaches and
methodologies in each component when building the RAG system and then finally choose the
approach and methodology which works best for you.
You are not compelled to use the sample data we provide for this project, if you have your own
documents or data, you are more than welcome to use it (but validate your data and idea with
us first), the project steps mentioned below would remain unchanged.
Project Goals:
The major project goals or objectives would include the following. You need to do all the key
goals mentioned in the compulsory goals section and at least 1 stretch goal (you are welcome
to do more).
Compulsory Goals:
● Get your own dataset or download the PDFs from here
● Load the files and index them in a vector database
● Experiment with different embedding models (open-source from huggingface and
commercial ones like OpenAI)
● Experiment with various retrieval strategies (simple cosine to hybrid search and
rerankers)
● Connect your vector database to an LLM and build a RAG pipeline
● Test the RAG pipeline on sample queries
● Try to also show the source of the generated response (which context documents were
used to generate the response - top 3 will do)
Stretch Goals (at least 1):
● Advanced Option 1: Enhance this system into a multi-user conversational RAG system.
Check out this example and try to adapt it
● Advanced Option 2: Build a streamlit or chainlit app on top of your RAG system
● Advanced Option 3: Try to enhance your system with web-search using Agentic
Corrective RAG patterns (covered in the module on Agents in the LangChain course) or
you can use our article as a reference
Milestones:
● Load and index RAG documents
● Experiment with Embeddings and build a Vector Database
● Experiment with various Retrieval strategies and finalize your retriever
● Build basic RAG system with answer sources
● Build enhanced RAG system or application based on stretch goals
Evaluation:
You are recommended to meet with a mentor at least once a week to review on your progress
and then do a final project walkthrough and demo of your project once you are ready and then
submit it.
